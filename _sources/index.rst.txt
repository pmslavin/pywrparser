The PywrParser Documentation
============================

`PywrParser` is a toolkit for parsing and manipulating `Pywr <https://github.com/pywr>`_ networks.
The toolkit consists of a command-line utility and a library, which together allow `PywrParser` to be
used directly and as a component of other projects.

The `PywrParser` source code is hosted `on GitHub <https://github.com/pmslavin/pywrparser>`_.
